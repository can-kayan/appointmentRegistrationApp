# Appointment Registration App

Project Description: Appointment registration app. There are 3 separate pages, including contact information and transactions, calendar and analysis. In addition to these, settings page, export, send mail, language change, theme change etc. included in the features. Finally, there is a help page for ease of use. Technologies / languages used c#, devexpres, mssql.

## Setup

Things to do after downloading the file:
1-Grant access to resx files
2-Create the database (I used mssql), paste the database connection path with the required place, don't forget to replace the links in the tables with your own link
3-If you don't have the devExpress file, this application will not work, some objects were made using devExpress (I will share the devexpress files later)

If you proceed to add user records directly after making the installation settings, they will not appear in the tables, first of all, you need to make the tables you want visible from the settings> table settings section.If there is a place that you do not understand and cannot find, you can use the help menu.
